                I'm a dedicated, self-taught engineer with industry experience building frontend and fullstack applications. My passion for design and seamless user experiences stems from a deep appreciation for art, aesthetics, and real-world utility. Before transitioning into tech, I spent six years as a barber, honing my eye for detail, creativity, and client-first problem-solving—skills I now bring into every product I build.
