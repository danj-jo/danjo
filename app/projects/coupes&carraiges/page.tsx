        Coupes and Carriages is a command-line interface (CLI) car dealership application I developed using Java. It allows users to check interest rates, VIN numbers, add cars to the inventory, and mark cars as sold. What makes this project particularly interesting is the extensive range of methods I implemented, all without relying on a web interface. This challenge highlighted my ability to manage complex functionality and business logic entirely within a CLI environment."
