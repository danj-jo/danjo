                The Ledge NoSQL is an independent project where I rewrote the group project I previously worked on, transitioning it from MySQL to MongoDB to gain hands-on experience with NoSQL using a standard tool. The project is an MVC-based CRUD accounting ledger application, where users can view, add, and display transactions. Rewriting the entire project allowed me to deepen my knowledge of MongoDB, which prepared me for my internship at LinkedIn. There, I worked on a project that received data from Espresso, LinkedIn's NoSQL data store.
