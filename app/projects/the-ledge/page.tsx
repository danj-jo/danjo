            The Ledge was a collaborative project developed using Java, Spring Boot, and SQL during my time in the Year Up Java-Based bootcamp. It is an MVC-based CRUD accounting ledger application that allows users to view, add, and display transactions. My primary responsibilities included configuring Spring Security settings for authorization and authentication, writing request methods to retrieve data from the database, and creating models for the project. Additionally, I contributed to writing SQL queries and developed several data access objects (DAOs).
